# Housing Price Prediction - End-to-End ML Project

This project walks through a complete machine learning workflow using the California housing dataset. It includes:

- Data exploration
- Data cleaning and feature engineering using pipelines
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- Final model evaluation on a test set
- Saving the trained model with `joblib`

## Final RMSE
The final model (RandomForestRegressor) achieved an RMSE of approximately **49,134** on the test set.

## Files
- `housing_end_to_end_project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full code
- `final_model.pkl`: Trained model saved with `joblib`
- ⚠️ The trained model file (`final_model.pkl`) is too large for GitHub upload.
You can retrain the model using the notebook.
